# Project Organization
We used **Scrum software development**  method to organize our project. We started by defining protocols which helped us to clearly understand what we are going to do. We divided tasks in sprint and had meeting once in two weeks.
In each meeting we track what have done and what is remaining. This helped us to manage our time properly.                                                               
                                                                                                                                                            
## Difficulties that we have faced
* Understanding the problem took many of our time even though everything was explained in the lab session it was difficult to start the programming.
* Java-Socket programming was a new concept for most of the group members, learning the new environment was also time taking.

* Working as a group is a difficult task and to manage the code but github helped us to collaborate and ease our work
* We faced a difficult situation to test the application with different computers. Since Covid-19 situation has raised in France, we were isolated from our group member and we faced some difficulties to test the application with many computers.
* Asymmetric encryption was developed in this project after some sort of modifications. Initially, we faced an issue to encrypt transaction data due to its size. Then proper algorithm was selected to the encryption function. Then we faced an issue to share the public key to other members because of the binary format of public key. The keys were encoded incorrectly then it was fixed with the use of jackson library.   

## Lesson learned 
* Understanding the concept of block chain.
* understanding how peer to peer protocol works works on application level.
* understanding how concurrency and multi-thread programming work. 
* How to decode and encode messages.
* How interoperability works.
* understanding and working with Java. Socket programming to implement peer to peer programming.
* Understanding the concept of Asymmetric encryption. 
* Working with My-sql for database.
* J-unit Automation for testing the project.
* Git Hub for managing the project
* Team management.
* How to organize the project and teamwork.
* Use of GitHub for project collaboration 
* Use of github for project management. (Issues and Milestone)
* How to debug network application. 


## What we would keep next time

* Similar project organization and managemnet. 
* Team communication techniques and tools. 
* The development approuch that we followed - Modul base development. 
* Better project plan that helps to adopt changes.
* Github for porject collabration and for version control. 
* Keeping Trello for project management 
* Following good practices of programming and application development methodology
* Pair programming. (Easy to fix bugs)

## What would be the improvement in next porject (What would you do differently)
* Better utilization of different Stack and better tools.
* Integration of new Testing tools Silenium etc. 
* Good communication with another team for proper implementation of interoperability.   
* Continous and frequent project meetings to increase community work.   
* Maximied use of GitHub for project collaboration
* Cloud deployment. (Helps to learn different technologies)
